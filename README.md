Paul Vezzetti @paulvezzetti

I'm currently a C++ developer but have worked in most major languages including Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, ActionScript, and Swift. 
I work with data visualization software developing tools for visualizing data using various type of charts.
I primarily work on Line Charts, Area Charts, Heatmaps, Histograms and Box Plots.

As fun as C++ can be, I also enjoy programming in Swift for iOS and would like to get back to doing JavaScript or other front-end programming.
